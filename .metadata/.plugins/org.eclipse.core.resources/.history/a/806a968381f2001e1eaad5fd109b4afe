//	⦁	Implement an own LinkedList class as CustomLinkedList<T extends Number>. It is a generic class to store any types of Number values. It has the following methods:
//	⦁	void add(T value, int index): inserts value under the given index. It throws an exception if the index is wrong.
//	⦁	int size(): returns the length of the List
//	⦁	Cover your solution by unit tests.
